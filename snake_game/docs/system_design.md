## Implementation approach:

Based on the requirements, we will implement the command-line snake game in Python using the following approach:

1. Use the `curses` library to create a command-line interface for the game.
2. Implement the game mechanics, including snake movement, food generation, and collision detection.
3. Display the game screen, including the snake, food, and score.
4. Handle user input to control the snake's movement using arrow keys.
5. Implement the scoring system and display the player's score on the screen.
6. Handle game over conditions, such as when the snake hits the wall or itself.
7. Allow the player to restart the game after it ends.

## Python package name:
```python
"snake_game"
```

## File list:
```python

    "main.py",
]
```

## Data structures and interface definitions:

    class Game {
        -int score
        -int width
        -int height
        -int speed
        -bool game_over
        -bool paused
        -Snake snake
        -Food food
        +__init__(self, width: int, height: int, speed: int)
        +start(self) -> None
        +update(self) -> None
        +draw(self) -> None
        +handle_input(self, key: int) -> None
        +game_over_screen(self) -> None
        +restart(self) -> None
    }

    class Snake {
        -List[Tuple[int, int]] body
        -Tuple[int, int] head
        -Tuple[int, int] direction
        +__init__(self, x: int, y: int)
        +move(self) -> None
        +change_direction(self, key: int) -> None
        +eat_food(self, food: Food) -> None
        +check_collision(self, width: int, height: int) -> bool
    }

    class Food {
        -Tuple[int, int] position
        +__init__(self, width: int, height: int)
        +generate(self) -> None
    }
    
    Game "1" -- "1" Snake: has
    Game "1" -- "1" Food: has
```

## Program call flow:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant G as Game
    participant S as Snake
    participant F as Food

    M->>G: Create game instance
    G->>G: Initialize game variables
    G->>G: Start the game loop
    G->>G: Update the game state
    G->>G: Draw the game screen
    G->>G: Handle user input
    G->>S: Move the snake
    G->>F: Check if the snake eats the food
    G->>S: Check if the snake hits the wall or itself
    G->>G: Update the score
    G->>G: Check if the game is over
    G->>G: Display the game over screen
    G->>G: Allow the player to restart the game
    G->>G: Repeat the game loop
```

## Anything UNCLEAR:
The requirements are clear to me.
