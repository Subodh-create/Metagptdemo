## Logic Analysis:

```python
[
    ("main.py", "Main"),
    ("game.py", "Game"),
    ("snake.py", "Snake"),
    ("food.py", "Food")
]
```

The `main.py` file contains the main entry point of the program. It creates an instance of the `Game` class and starts the game loop.

The `game.py` file contains the `Game` class, which is responsible for managing the game state, updating the game, handling user input, and displaying the game screen.

The `snake.py` file contains the `Snake` class, which represents the snake in the game. It handles the movement of the snake, changing its direction, checking for collisions, and eating food.

The `food.py` file contains the `Food` class, which represents the food in the game. It generates food at random positions on the game screen.

The `Game` class has a dependency on the `Snake` and `Food` classes, as it needs to interact with them to update the game state.

## Task list:

```python
[
    "main.py",
    "game.py",
    "snake.py",
    "food.py"
]
