## Logic Analysis:

```python
[
    ("main.py", "main entry point"),
    ("game_logic.py", "Game class and game logic"),
    ("player.py", "Player class"),
    ("dealer.py", "Dealer class"),
    ("deck.py", "Deck class"),
    ("card.py", "Card class"),
    ("ascii_art.py", "AsciiArt class"),
    ("cli.py", "CLI class"),
    ("utils.py", "Utils class")
]
```

The dependencies between the files are as follows:
- main.py depends on game_logic.py, player.py, dealer.py, deck.py, card.py, ascii_art.py, cli.py, and utils.py
- game_logic.py depends on player.py, dealer.py, deck.py, and card.py
- player.py and dealer.py depend on card.py
- deck.py depends on card.py
- cli.py depends on game_logic.py and ascii_art.py
- utils.py does not have any dependencies

## Task list:

```python
[
    "card.py",
    "deck.py",
    "player.py",
    "dealer.py",
    "game_logic.py",
    "ascii_art.py",
    "utils.py",
    "cli.py",
    "main.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge:

```python
"""
The 'utils.py' file contains utility functions for clearing the screen and printing colorful messages.

The 'ascii_art.py' file contains the AsciiArt class, which is used to generate ASCII art for cards.

The 'card.py' file contains the Card class, which represents a playing card.

The 'deck.py' file contains the Deck class, which represents a deck of cards.

The 'player.py' file contains the Player class, which represents a player in the game.

The 'dealer.py' file contains the Dealer class, which represents the dealer in the game.

The 'game_logic.py' file contains the Game class, which represents the game logic.

The 'cli.py' file contains the CLI class, which handles the command-line interface for the game.

The 'main.py' file is the main entry point of the program.
